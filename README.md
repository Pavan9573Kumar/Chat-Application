Real-Time Chat Application Using Node.js and Socket.io

  In this project, a real-time chat application has been developed. The code creates a Node.js server using the Socket.IO library to handle socket connections. We will be using Socket.io to enable real-time, bidirectional communication between the web server and the client (browser).
